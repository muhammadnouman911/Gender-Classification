# 🚻 Gender Classification

This project focuses on classifying gender based on voice or biometric data using various machine learning algorithms.  
It explores and compares the performance of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** on a gender classification dataset.
